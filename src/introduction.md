# Introduction

These notes serve as material for the *Advanced Programming* course at
[DIKU](https://diku.dk). They do not form a complete textbook and may
not be comprehensible outside the context of the course. In
particular, they assume that basic Haskell programming skills are
acquired through other means, for example via textbooks such as
[Programming in Haskell](https://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/pih.html).
The notes serve to emphasize the course perspectives, as well as
contain material that we could not find of sufficient quality and
brevity elsewhere.
